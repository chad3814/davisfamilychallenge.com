  <h1>Seventh Annual Davis Family Challenge</h1>
  <h2>Mystery Board Game</h2>
  <p>Grammy bought this game on black friday and forgot what it
was. After opening the wrapping paper, it was discovered to be “5 Second Rule: Just Spit It Out”. The Captain, Uncle Giant and J.D. all tied for first, with Grammy bringing up the rear in eighth place.</p>
  <h2>Bags</h2>
  <p>“Bags” was a bean bag toss game. Canadian Katie took a decisive lead with 5 points (in only two bags). After the first round, Uncle Giant, Lorelei, Cat and Chad were tied for second at four bags which triggered a bag-off! Uncle Giant ended the bag-off with second place.</p>
  <h2>Game Day Decision</h2>
  <p>Canadian Katie brought “Game Day Decision”, she chose a game from her “90 Great Games” disc. We played a Luge game, after a lot of smack talking, <i>unfortunately a clerical error has lost all remaining details from 2012</i></p>
