  <h1>Tenth Annual Davis Family Challenge</h1>
  <h2>Ten Thousand</h2>
  <p>Steph's game was first, and she started out strong, scoring in
the first nine rounds, and dominating the early game. We decided
before play started to go to 8,000 instead of 10,000. In the tenth
round Grammy 2,200 points to jump into the lead. She hit 8,000 in the
13th round, and nobody caught her despite Eddie nearly getting 3,150
in the last round. Team Eddie won.</p>
  <h2><a name="ispy">I Spy</a></h2>
  <p>Grammy's game of I Spy, was played with a revolving Christmas
Tree. Players drew a card that had a picture of a random ornament on
it and they were timed to find the ornament on the tree. Team Eddie
had a big lead that Team Steph was unable to overcome. Team Eddie won
22:07 to Team Steph's 22:51 (despite the late argument about Uncle
Giant's reach around).</p>
  <h2>King of Tokyo</h2>
  <p>Eddie's Game was King of Tokyo. Each team fielded a duo
controlling a monster. Eddie/Uncle Giant, Chad/Captain, J.D./Grammy,
Cat/Lorelei. Eddie & Uncle Giant got the victory, giving Team Eddie a
three-game sweep! The other duos were all close in experience and
health.</p>
  <h2>In Your Face: The Pie Eating Contest</h2>
  <p>We didn't get to Lorelei's game, where teams would have had to
eat a slice of chocolate pie without using their hands.</p>
  <h2>Pictionary</h2>
  <p>We didn't get to Uncle Giant's game.</p>
