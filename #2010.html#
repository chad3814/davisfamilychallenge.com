  <h1>Fifth Annual Davis Family Challenge</h1>
  <h2>Soccer Croquet</h2>
  <p>After the captain failed the first hoop, everyone else on the Old Timers made it through the first, and Cat made it through the second. All of The Youngins save Jenelle failed the first hoop, but Jenelle pulled it out for her team by getting the second. Having faced a tie we decided Cat and Jenelle each would get two chances at the third hoop. When they both failed we called it a tie of 2-2.</p>
  <h2>Trivia</h2>
  <p>Old Timers win 8-7.</p>
  <h2>Minute-To-Win-It Nut Stacker</h2>
  <p>Eddie started it out with a bang! He got his four nuts stacked super quick. Lorelei was able to knock it out as well. After the kids, everyone succeeded except for Jenelle and the Captain. The pressure was on as Uncle Giant and Cat came up to play. Uncle Gaint had the advantage of playing it before, and Cat choked. 3-2 Youngins.</p>
  <h2>Minute-To-Win-It Candy Cane Grab</h2>
  <p>Lorelei tried to show Eddie how to do it, but she failed. Eddie succeeded with the Captain's help. Next Chad blew it out and Uncle Giant failed. The Captain followed Chad's lead and J.D. sealed The Youngin's fate with his loss. The Oldtimers won with 4-2.</p>
  <h2>Present Unwrap Race</h2>
  <p>The Oldtimers were just too feebal.</p>
