<h1>Fourteenth Annual Davis Family Challenge</h1>
  <p>We tried to have Xeno draw names from a container, but failed, so Eddie drew them.</p>
  <h2>J.D./Eddie's Game - Pencil Flip</h2>
  <p>J.D. left his game at the checkout counter at WalMart, so he designated Eddie for a substitute game. Four solo cups and eight pencils were setup for each team. Everybody attempts to bounce the two pencils (one at a time) into their assigned cup, similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4hK6IhCwMY">here</a>, but in a relay fashion, one team member at a time. Uncle Giant lead with the first pencil in, but Grammy answered back quickly. Unfortunately for team Turkey Tossers, that's all they got. The Turkey Catchers won after the Monsters conceded. Eddie got one, J.D. got one, Uncle Giant got both, and Grammy got one.</p>
