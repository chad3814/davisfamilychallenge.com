<h1>Twelfth Annual Davis Family Challenge</h1>
  <p>We drew names from a hat to determine which games would be played.</p>
  <h2>Eddie's Game - Move the M&M's</h2>
  <p>Players had 25 M&M's on a plate, a straw and an empty plate. Two
players from each team went all at once, grabbing M&M's with suction
to move the M&M's one at a time to the other plate. Uncle Giant &
Eddie were the first set on the Middle team and Grammy and J.D. were
first. We timed the first round at a 60 seconds, and everyone was able
to move all 25 over. The second round, we set the timer at 25 seconds,
and Chad and Cat move a total of 21 over, where as Lorelei and Poppa
moved a total of 34. A win for the Middle, 84-71.</p>
  <h2>J.D.'s Game - Santa's Christmas Cookies</h2>
  <p>We cleared all the chairs from the table, and stood every-other
player around the table. J.D. had wrapped a a series of boxes inside
of each other. While one person wore a santa hat and oven mits and
tried to open the presents, the next person was rolling two dice. When
the dice person rolled doubles, everything moved one person over. In
the last box, there was a note that said "You Win!". Some boxes had
Uno-like instructions like, reverse or skip; and some had instructions
to pass the present to a specific person. There were not a lot of long
spells without doubles, but eventually Chad got the last box open for
the win, tying the DFC to 1-1.</p>
  <h2>Lorelei's Game - Builder Boom</h2>
  <p>Started with Uncle Giant vs Chad, but Chad was at a distinct
disadvantage having never played this game before. Uncle Giant easily
won. Next he faced Cat and lost! Then Cat faced Lorelei and Cat
lost. Next Lorelei faced J.D. and J.D. pulled out the win. That
brought up the Captain as the Middle's last hope. J.D. crushed the
Captain, taking the DFC to 2-1, Top-Bottom.</p>
  <h2>Chad's Game - Imagine</h2>
  <p>"Imagine: The Animated Guessing Game" was a board game Chad got
for Christmas, so nobody had played it before. We played two rounds,
and after the first the teams were tied. Despite nobody guessing Uncle
Giant's "chihuahua" by him just pointing at a dog bone, the Middles
won, tying the DFC at 2-2.</p>
  <h2>Uncle Giant's Game - Bounce</h2>
  <p>Players stood behind a line and had to bounce ping pong balls
into a 1/2 egg carton. Each player had 12 chances, and we alternated
teams, Chad went first and got 2 in. Eddie went second, but failed to
get any in. Grammy stepped up third, after getting robbed a few times,
she did get 2 to stay in. Lorelei was fourth and started strong with a
couple close misses, but ended up with only 1. Cat was up next, she
was unsure, and despite going down to her knees she was unable to get
any in. Poppa was up sixth, he got his first one in, and then
perseeded to have near misses on almost every other on, ending with 2
in. J.D. came out strong in the begining, get balls 3 and 4 in, and
finished strong getting the last ball in, for 3. Uncle Giant finished
up, his team down by four. He made his last ball, scoring just 1, so
the Top-Bottom team won 7-4.</p>
