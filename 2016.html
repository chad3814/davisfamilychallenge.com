<h1>Eleventh Annual Davis Family Challenge</h1>
  <p>We drew cards from a standard 52-card pack, whoever cut the highest
cards, their game was played.</p>
  <h2>The Great Dalmuti</h2>
  <p>Chad drew a Queen, so his game was first. He decided we'd play
two rounds, and each player would score points for their team given
their fininishing position. Zero points for Greater Peon, one for
Lesser Peon, 2-5 for the Merchants, seven for Lesser Dalmuti and nine
for Great Dalmuti. Each team could only have four people play. We
randomly picked original starting positions:
<ul>
  <li>Steph as Greater Dalmuti</li>
  <li>Captain as Lesser Dalmuti</li>
  <li>Lorelei as First Merchant</li>
  <li>Uncle Giant as Second Merchant</li>
  <li>Grammy as Third Merchant</li>
  <li>J.D. as Fourth Merchant</li>
  <li>Cat as Lesser Peon</li>
  <li>Chad as Greater Peon</li>
</ul>
In the first round, the Captian and Uncle Giant scored a coup and
finished first and second. It came down to the battle between Cat and
J.D. for the Greater and Lesser Peonship, with Cat claiming a victory
as Lesser.
<ul>
  <li>Captain as Greater Dalmuti</li>
  <li>Uncle Giant as Lesser Dalmuti</li>
  <li>Lorelei as First Merchant</li>
  <li>Chad as Second Merchant</li>
  <li>Grammy as Third Merchant</li>
  <li>Steph as Fourth Merchant</li>
  <li>Cat as Lesser Peon</li>
  <li>J.D. as Greater Peon</li>
</ul>
In the second round, the Boys team worked together to secure the
victory, once again placing The Captain and Uncle Giant in the Dalmuti
seats.
<ul>
  <li>Captain as Greater Dalmuti</li>
  <li>Uncle Giant as Lesser Dalmuti</li>
  <li>Chad as First Merchant</li>
  <li>Grammy as Second Merchant</li>
  <li>Steph as Third Merchant</li>
  <li>J.D. as Fourth Merchant</li>
  <li>Lorelei as Lesser Peon</li>
  <li>Cat as Greater Peon</li>
</ul>
Score for the first round was Boys 20, Girls 11. Second round was
Boys 23, Girls 8; for a total of 43-19. Boys win!</p>
  <h2>Candy Can Drop</h2>
  <p>Eddie drew a Jack, his game was second. Each participant stood on
a chair and dropped a candy cane, trying to hook it onto a
garland suspended between the two chairs. Each person had four candy
canes to attempt. Eddie started off the boys team with one hooked,
Meredith didn't get any. Then Chad and Lorelei split and each hooked
one. J.D. and Grammy both failed to hook any, then Captain beat Steph,
hooking one to her none. In the final match up, Uncle Giant stared
down Cat, forcing her to make to try to make them all. Both failed to
hook any, boys win 3-1.</p>
  <h2>Christmas Tree Punch</h2>
  <p>Lorelei drew a Ten, her game was third. She had hot-glued solo
cups to a peg board, then covered each cup with tissue paper and held
that in place with a rubber band. Inside each cup was hidden some
number of candy. Hersey Kisses are worth 1 point, Kit-Kats are worth
5 points, and Mint Patties are worth 3. Mer went first and got a
Hersey Kiss. Eddie followed with a mint. Then Lorelei got two kisses.
Captain got the first Kit-Kat. Grammy had a masterstroke of a single
Kiss. J.D. got a huge cup of five kisses. Steph followed with two
kisses. Chad, Cat, & Uncle Giant each got a single kiss. Mer got three
kisses. Eddie got two kisses, and Lore a mint. Captain brought home a
win for the boys with another Kit-Kat. Grammy helped the girls out
with four kisses. J.D. choose wisely with four kisses. Steph changed
the game with TWO Kit-Kats! Chad got another single kiss, but Cat
answered back with four kisses. Uncle Giant and Mer each picked a
single kiss. Eddie helped the boys with a mint. Lore somehow picked
out a peanut butter cup, and then Eddie tried to sabotage the boys by
saying it was worth 20 points, but the boys, talked them down to 1
point. The Captain's magic fingers failed him, finding only a single
kiss. Grammy then pulled out two kisses. J.D. pulled out two kisses,
Steph answered back with two kisses and a rolo. Chad helped out with a
Kit-Kat, but Cat answered back immediately with another Kit-Kat. Uncle
Giant pulled four kisses. Mer picked one kiss. Eddie got three kisses.
Lore pulled a single kiss, and The Captain picked a cup with a single
kiss. Grammy grabbed a kiss. J.D. got two and Steph three kisses. Chad
and Cat each grabbed three kisses. Uncle Giant picked three kisses,
Mer got a single kiss, and Eddie found a missed one and opened the
last cup for five kisses. Lore found another kiss which gave the girls
a total of 54 points. The Boys ended up with 61 points, for the win!</p>
  <h2>Escape Room</h2>
  <p>Cat drew an Eight, her game was fourth, although it wasn't
required we elected to play it anyway. The Boys won that too, they
escaped the Astronomer's room and saved the town, 4 minutes faster
than the Girls.</p>
  <h2>Pyramid</h2>
  <p>Uncle Giant and Steph each drew a Four, on the rematch Uncle
Giant drew a Jack, so his game was fifth, we didn't need to play it,
but we decided to play anyway. It was like the TV show $100,000
Pyramid. There were eight categories: 'T' Words, 'R' Words, Words That
End in 'Z', Winter Words, Words That Contain 'BASE', Things That Are
Green, Things That You Turn On, and Pizza Toppings. Chad and Eddie
were horrible clue givers, and everyone else excelled. The Girls won 27-16.</p>
