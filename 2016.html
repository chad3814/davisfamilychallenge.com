  <h1>Eleventh Annual Davis Family Challenge</h1>
  <h2>The Great Dalmuti</h2>
  <p>Chad drew a Queen, so his game was first. He decided we'd play
two rounds, and each player would score points for their team given
their fininishing position. Zero points for Greater Peon, one for
Lesser Peon, 2-5 for the Merchants, seven for Lesser Dalmuti and nine
for Great Dalmuti. Each team could only have four people play. We
randomly picked original starting positions: Steph as Greater Dalmuti,
Captain as Lesser Dalmuti, Lorelei, Uncle Giant, Grammy and James as
Merchants, Cat as Lesser Peon and Chad as Greater Peon. After the
first round: Captian is Great Dalmuti, Uncle Giant is Lesser Dalmuti,
Lorelei is first Merchant, Chad is second, Grammy is third and Steph
is fourth Merchant. Cat was Lesser Peon and James Greater Peon.
Captain, Giant, Chad, Grammy, Steph, James, Lore, Cat. Score for the
first round was 20-11, second round was 23-8; for a total of 43-19.</p>
  <h2>Candy Can Drop</h2>
  <p>Eddie drew a Jack, his game was second. Each participant stood on
a chair and dropped a candy cane, trying to hook it onto a
garland. Eddie started off the boys team with one hooked, Meredith
didn't get any. Then Chad and Lorelei split and each hooked one. James
and Grammy both failed to hook any, then Captain beat Steph, hooking
one to her none. In the final match up, Uncle Giant stared down Cat,
forcing her to make to try to make them all. Both failed to hook any,
boys win 3-1.</p>
