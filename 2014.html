  <h1>Ninth Annual Davis Family Challenge</h1>
  <h2>20+1</h2>
  <p>This was the game Uncle Giant brought, each team had to pick two
people to represent their team to play blackjack. Each player started
with five pennies. Chad and J.D. represented Team Winners while Lorelei
and Captain represented The Captain &amp; the Girls. Captain and J.D. both
lost on the same round, but eventually Chad beat Lorelei and Team
Winners won.</p>
  <h2>Imagine If</h2>
  <p>This was a board game Grammy brought. We decided that first team
with two across the finish line would win. Steph went across first
followed by Tom and Captain, giving The Captain &amp; the Girls the win.</p>
  <h2>Christmas Bowling</h2>
  <p>This was the game Eddie brought. Lorelei started out by
complaining that she is not very good at it, and only Eddie is good at
it. We played three frames each, The Captain &amp; the Girls eeked out a
win with an average of 20.5 vs Team Winners average of 20.2.</p>
  <h2>Translations</h2>
  <p>This was the game Lorelei brought. It consists something written
in Elvish, and an Elvish - English alphabet conversion. Each team sent
two players to decode, TC&amp;tG sent Steph and Captain; Team Winners sent
Eddie and J.D. After five minutes, Team Winners had 7 correct letters,
TC&amp;tG had 5 correct letters.</p>
  <h2>Sudoku</h2>
  <p>This was the game Chad brought. Each team got four Easy, four
Medium and four Hard sudoku puzzles. The first team to complete one
easy, one medium and one hard would be declared the winner. TC&amp;tG
decided that Chad couldn't play and Eddie gave up helping right away,
leaving Team Winners with only three adults to do the puzzles, while TC&amp;tG
had three adults and Lorelei. TC&amp;tG split up, Steph and Lorelei worked
on an Easy puzzle while The Captain and Cat worked on a Medium
puzzle. On Team Winners side, J.D. started with a Medium, Grammy
started with an Easy and Uncle Giant started with a Hard. After a bit,
Cat and The Captain finished their Medium, and about 1/2 minute later
Steph and Lorelei finished their Easy. All four of them went to work
on a Hard. About that time, Uncle Giant gave up and switched with
J.D. stating, "those are all wrong." J.D. started over on a new
Hard. Then about four minutes later Grammy gave up, and switched with
Uncle Giant. About five minutes later Uncle Giant thought he was done
with the Easy, but then he saw a problem. It was too cumbersome with
four people trying to look at one puzzle, so TC&amp;tG ripped their Hard
sheet in 1/2 and Steph and Lorelei worked on one Hard while The
Captain and Cat worked on the original. Uncle Giant couldn't find his
mistake and switched again with Grammy. Then got frustrated with the
Medium and switch again with J.D. Eventually the pain was too much,
and Chad called it. TC&amp;tG had two correct puzzles, and Team Winners had
none. Game to The Captain &amp; the Girls.</p>
