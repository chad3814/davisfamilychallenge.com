The first team to complete one\neasy, one medium and one hard would be declared the winner. TC&tG\ndecided that Chad couldn't play and Eddie gave up helping right away,\nleaving Team Winners with only three adults to do the puzzles, while TC&tG\nhad three adults and Lorelei. TC&tG split up, Steph and Lorelei worked\non an Easy puzzle while The Captain and Cat worked on a Medium\npuzzle. On Team Winners side, J.D. started with a Medium, Grammy\nstarted with an Easy and Uncle Giant started with a Hard. After a bit,\nCat and The Captain finished their Medium, and about 1/2 minute later\nSteph and Lorelei finished their Easy. All four of them went to work\non a Hard. About that time, Uncle Giant gave up and switched with\nJ.D. stating, \"those are all wrong.\" J.D. started over on a new\nHard. Then about four minutes later Grammy gave up, and switched with\nUncle Giant. About five minutes later Uncle Giant thought he was done\nwith the Easy, but then he saw a problem. It was too cumbersome with\nfour people trying to look at one puzzle, so TC&tG ripped their Hard\nsheet in 1/2 and Steph and Lorelei worked on one Hard while The\nCaptain and Cat worked on the original. Uncle Giant couldn't find his\nmistake and switched again with Grammy. Then got frustrated with the\nMedium and switch again with J.D. Eventually the pain was too much,\nand Chad called it. TC&tG had two correct puzzles, and Team Winners had\nnone. Game to The Captain & the Girls."
