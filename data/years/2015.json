We decided\nbefore play started to go to 8,000 instead of 10,000. In the tenth\nround Grammy 2,200 points to jump into the lead. She hit 8,000 in the\n13th round, and nobody caught her despite Eddie nearly getting 3,150\nin the last round. Team Eddie won.\n\nGrammy's game of I Spy, was played with a revolving Christmas\nTree. Players drew a card that had a picture of a random ornament on\nit and they were timed to find the ornament on the tree. Team Eddie\nhad a big lead that Team Steph was unable to overcome. Team Eddie won\n22:07 to Team Steph's 22:51 (despite the late argument about Uncle\nGiant's reach around)."
