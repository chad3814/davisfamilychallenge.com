Eddie tossed to Shep, sinking an impressive zero. J.D. then missed with his first two throws with Lorelei catching, but then sunk four in a row. Team Losers with an unbeatable 7 baskets. Finally Cat regained some measure of pride for Team Underdogs, sinking her last throw to the basket on Grammy's head."

      "name": "Uncle Giant's Game: Ball Golf",
      "description": "A putting green was rolled out with 3 holes at one end. Along the sides of the green are measurements from the end, 1 foot to 7 feet. Sinking a putt from the 1 foot line scores 7 points, 2 foot lin 6 points, and so on to the 7 foot line scores 1 point. Each player gets a practice ball and a game ball. Eddie started it out for the Team Underdogs, sinking his practice putt from the two foot mark, then failing from the same place for his game ball. Lorelei was next up for the Losers and failed both her practice and game balls from the 1 foot line. Cat, second to go for the Underdogs, hit her practice ball a little hard from the 2 foot line. Then missed from the 1 foot line. Chad thought he was smart, and placed the ball on the 6 foot line, easily sinking his practice putt. Then on his game ball it ringed hole. Shep, taking no chances, placed his practice and game ball on the 7 foot line, sinking them both. Putting the Underdogs up 1-0. J.D. looked strong, sinking his practice putt from 4 foot line, however missed his game ball. Grammy, tapped into her previous golf experience and sunk her game ball from the 5 foot line adding to the Underdogs' lead, 4-0. Uncle Giant, however, tied the game up, sinking his practice and game ball from the 4 foot line. In a tie breaker round, there was no practice stroke. Eddie and Lorelei missed their strokes, Cat sunk one from the 6 foot for 2 point, then Chad missed from 5 foot. Shep followed up sinking a putt from 7 foot, to add a point to the Underdogs, 3-0 in the second round. J.D. tried to tie them up with a put from 5 foot, but missed. Grammy added insult to injury and sunk another putt, Uncle Giant went for the win instead of another tie, based on his team's suggestions, but missed. The Underdogs win."

      "description": "Each team had a bottle, a string and two candy canes. With a teammate on each end of the string, a candy cane was slide down the string and they had to coordinate to put a the candy into the bottle, then the other teammate would slid their candy cane onto the line and the first team to put both candy canes into the bottle one. First was Chad and Lorelei vs Cat and Grammy, while Chad and Lorelei had the first cane in, they had a fail with the second candy cane, with it popping off the line. Cat and Grammy meanwhile, were calm and collected, putting both of the canes into the bottle before Chad and Lorelei could recover. In the second round it was J.D. and Uncle Giant vs Shep and Eddie. Shep and Eddie were so quick, J.D. and Uncle Giant barely had their first cane in when they won."

      "description": "Fifty red solo cups were placed randomly on the floor, half right side up, half upside down. Team Underdogs had to turn cups right side up, and team Loser had to turn them upside down. It was a continous 12 minutes, and at 3 minute intervals players had to swap. In addition to flipping cups, players had to wear a stocking wrapped around their head. Chad and Grammy were first up, and Chad set the pace of Losers have most cup on their side, as well, as making sure the other player's stocking came off. As the pairing progressed it got rowdier and rowdier ending with Uncle Giant and Shep almost in a full out brawl, each spending most their time knocking over the other teams cups. Team Losers won 14 cups to 4 cups, and won the day!"
