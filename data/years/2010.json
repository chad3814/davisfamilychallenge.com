All of The Youngins save Jenelle failed the first hoop, but Jenelle pulled it out for her team by getting the second. Having faced a tie we decided Cat and Jenelle each would get two chances at the third hoop. When they both failed we called it a tie of 2-2."

After the kids, everyone succeeded except for Jenelle and the Captain. The pressure was on as Uncle Giant and Cat came up to play. Uncle Giant had the advantage of playing it before, and Cat choked. 3-2 Youngins."
