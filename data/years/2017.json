While one person wore a santa hat and oven mits and\ntried to open the presents, the next person was rolling two dice. When\nthe dice person rolled doubles, everything moved one person over. In\nthe last box, there was a note that said \"You Win!\". Some boxes had\nUno-like instructions like, reverse or skip; and some had instructions\nto pass the present to a specific person. There were not a lot of long\nspells without doubles, but eventually Chad got the last box open for\nthe win, tying the DFC to 1-1."

J.D. crushed the\nCaptain, taking the DFC to 2-1, Top-Bottom."
