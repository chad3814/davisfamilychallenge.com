## The Problem

### Family Memories Fade and Scatter
Family traditions create countless memories, but details blur over time. Photos live on phones, videos on hard drives, and stories exist only in aging memories. After 19 years of annual Davis Family Challenge competitions, there's a rich history spanning multiple generations - but without proper preservation, these moments risk being forgotten or fragmented.

**Our Solution:** A centralized, permanent digital archive that documents every game, every player, every memorable moment from 2006 to present, making 19 years of family history accessible in one place.

### Statistics and Records Lack a Single Source of Truth
With nearly two decades of competition, tracking lifetime wins, losses, and standings becomes impossible without a reliable system. Family members want to know their records, compare performances, and celebrate achievements.

**Our Solution:** A comprehensive scoreboard system tracking lifetime records (wins-losses-percentage) and overall standings, providing definitive statistics that settle debates and recognize achievements.

### Future Generations Won't Understand the Context
Today's family members know the inside jokes, understand the rivalries, and remember why certain games were hilarious. Future children and grandchildren won't have that context unless it's documented.

**Our Solution:** Detailed year-by-year narratives with play-by-play descriptions, team schemes, and game themes that capture not just results but the stories, personalities, and emotions that make each competition memorable.

## Differentiators

### Simplicity Over Complexity
Unlike photo-sharing platforms that require accounts, apps, and constant updates, we provide a simple HTML archive that will remain accessible for decades. No login required, no platform dependencies, no broken links when services shut down. Just permanent, readable HTML that works on any device with a browser.

This results in zero maintenance burden, guaranteed longevity, and universal accessibility across all devices and platforms.

### Narrative Over Data
Unlike spreadsheets or databases that track only wins and losses, we prioritize storytelling. Each year has detailed game-by-game narratives that capture the humor, drama, and personality of competitions, not just the final scores.

This results in an engaging read that entertains rather than just informs, making the archive something family members actually want to revisit.

### Archive Over Social Media
Unlike social media posts that get buried in feeds, algorithms, or deleted accounts, we maintain a permanent, organized archive where every year is easily accessible. Content is deliberately organized by year with clear navigation, not chronologically scattered or algorithmically sorted.

This results in reliable access to any competition from 2006 forward, ensuring nothing is lost to platform changes, account deletions, or feed algorithms.
