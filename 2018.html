<h1>Thirteenth Annual Davis Family Challenge</h1>
  <p>We drew names from a hat to determine which games would be played.</p>
  <h2>Uncle Giant's Game - Throwback Heads-Up</h2>
  <p>First up, Uncle Giant had a throw back to DFCs past. He had Heads-Up setup on his phone so it could be anything. There were three rounds, in the first round each team picked the guesser and the clue giver for the other team. Team Bacon went first with Chad giving clues to Grammy. It was so unbelievable that she couldn't get Harry Potter! Grammy successfully guess three things before time ran out. Round one for Oreo Music Box saw Captain giving clues and Cat guessing, they also managed to get three correct. Round two each team picked the clue giver and guesser from the other team's two remaining teammates, so J.D. gave Eddie clues, and their overlap of knowledge was not very much, they got two right. Heads-Up is basically the perfect game for both Lorelei and Uncle Giant. She gave him clues, and they crushed it with an amazing six correct answers. That left Team Bacon with five points and Oreo Music Box with nine. In the third round, each team got to pick their own guesser and clue giver. Bacon selected Chad to give clues to Eddie, since "their knowledge overlaps so much". Unfortunately, all the things that came up were movie and television actors from the 70's and 80's that he wouldn't know! We managed to squeak out another three points, putting Bacon at eight. To rub it in a little more, Oreo Music Box went again anyway with the same Lorelei/Uncle Giant combo. They got four more points they didn'tneed and Oreo Music Box was off to a great start, winning the first game 13 to 8.</p>
  <h2>Chad's Game - Tenzi Extreme</h2>
  <p>Each team was given 27 dice. Six were placed on a <a href="tenzi-extreme-card.pdf">score card</a>, and put a die in each unlocked box, 1-6. With the other 21 dice, they had to roll one 1, two 2's, three 3's, four 4's, five 5's, and six 6's. Each time they completed one of those, they put those dice aside and move their marked from Unlocked to Locked. Both teams continously rolled at the same time until one team locked all thier dice. Bother teams got the 1's, 2's and 3's quickly. Bacon got 4's and 5's pretty soon after. Oreo Music Box seemed to purposefully not lock their 4's so they had a better chance at 5's and 6's. Oreo Music Box locked their 5's before Bacon and only had 6's and 4's left, while Bacon only had 6's. Realizing that it would've been smarter to lock up 6's and 5's when we had more dice, both teams unlocked the lower 1-3's in order to get 6's. Bacon eventually unlocked 4's too. Bacon got 6's and then 3's, 4's 2's and lastly 1's to win. Oreo Music Box was still sitting with just 5's locked. Now the teams were tied, one game win each.</p>
  <h2>J.D.'s Game - Oreo Head Catch</h2>
  <p>J.D. saw a YouTube video of someone moving an <a href="https://youtu.be/ssRSScLCZA0">oreo from their forehead to their mouth</a> in a Minute-to-Win-It challenge, so he devised this game. Everybody got three oreos and five minutes, you could try as many times as you needed to get an oreo from your forehead to your mouth without using your hands. We totalled up the oreos that made it at the end and the team with more won. If there had been a tie we would've had sudden death forehead oreo faceoff. Chad gave Bacon an early lead getting his first oreo into his mouth in about 15 seconds. J.D. and Uncle Giant followed with their first and Chad got a second. About two minutes in Chad got his third oreo and started <a href="oreo.mp4">recording</a> everyone else try. In the end, Bacon had six oreos eaten, three from J.D> and three from Chad. Oreo Music Box had five oreos eaten, three from Uncle Giant and two from Cat. Bacon pulled ahead, two games to one.</p>
  <h2>Lorelei's Game - Christmas Drawing</h2>
<p>In this game, everyone (except Lorelei) had a peice of paper and a pen or pencil. We all oriented the paper landscape and closed our eyes. Lorelei instructed us what to draw and where. It started out with a sleigh in the center of the paper, then a pine tree to the left of the sleigh, then draw snowflakes, then draw Santa in the sleigh, put ornements on the tree, next put a moon in the sky. Next put jingle bells on the sleigh and pile up presents in the sleigh. Then everyone scored points if certain things were correctly placed, or you made certain embellishments. Each team's scores were averaged from the number of people drawing (since Lorelei wasn't drawing, Oreo Music Box only had three people). But that wasn't needed. Bacon averaged 15.2 and Oreo Music Box 23.6. Oreo Music Box crushed it, with their total beating Bacon's total even though Bacon had one more person. The teams were tied again, at two games each.<br/>

  <h2>Eddie's Game - Baconator</h2>
  <p>The deciding game was a relay to make bacon sandwiches. Each person was given two strips of bacon and a peice of bread. They had to move the bacon, one strip at a time onto the bread. The strips had to cross when on the bread, and they could use their hands. Also eyes closed. For Bacon the relay went: J.D. -> Chad -> Eddie -> Grammy. For Oreo Music Box the relay went: Cat -> Uncle Giant -> Lorelei -> Captain. THe person next in line was supposed to coach the other person, with J.D. coaching Grammy and Cat coaching Captain. Both teams had strong starts, but Chad couldn't get his bacon crossed, leading to Bacon's demise in the Baconator game. Oreo Music Box handily won the game, and the Davis Family Challenge.</p>
