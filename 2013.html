  <h1>Eighth Annual Davis Family Challenge</h1>
  <h2>Spiderman Uno</h2>
  <p>This was the game Eddie brought, we decided the winning team would be the first team with two players to go out. Even though Cat was the first to go out, Team Awesome rallied for the win after J.D. went out and forced Uncle Giant to let the Captain go out. Team Awesome wins, 2-1.</p>
  <h2>Water Pong</h2>
  <p>This was the game The Captain brought, two bowls, one orange and
one purple were set at one end of the diningroom, each with a little
water in them. Contestants took turns bouncing ping pong balls into
them. Team Awesome picked the purple bowl and Team Plan B picked
orange bowl. We added up all the balls in each bowl at the end. Eddie
started out his team out with 1 in the orange bowl. Lore answered back
with 1 in the purple bowl. Cat then helped out Team Awesome wiht a
ball in the purple bowl. J.D. answered back with a masterful 3 in the
purple bowl. Uncle Giant's second shot was a nail biter, spiraling
around the edge of the orange bowl, but he ended with 1 in the orange
bowl. Chad scraped by with 2 in the purple bowl. Grammy must've been a
little confused about what team she was playing on, first she got one
in orange, then one in purple, finally another in orange, netting her
team +1 overall. The Captain came out strong with 2 in purple in the
beginning, then ended with 1 in orange. Team Awesome wins again, 10-4</p>
  <h2>Cups</h2>
  <p>This was the game Uncle Giant brought. Players were given 24 Solo
cups of one color and 1 of a different color. Starting with the odd
color on the bottom, they had to transfer the top cup to the bottom
with one hand, then do it again with the other hand. The first to have
the odd cup back on the bottom wins. Lorelei beat Eddie in the first
round, but Team Plan B came back when Uncle Giant beat Chad in the
second round. Team A wasn't happy with that though, so J.D. whipped
Cat and then the Captain finished it up with a win again Grammy. Team
Awesome wins again and looks like they will sweep the Davis Family
Challenge, 3-1</p>
  <h2>Heads Up</h2>
  <p>This was the game J.D. "brought". It is an iOS game, sort of like a
reverse charades, one person has a word on an iPhone on the their
forehead, and his or her team has to get the person to guess it. Eddie
started with the "Happy Holidays" category and finished with a score
of two. Lorelei scored Team Awesome four points also in "Happy
Holidays". Cat floundered on 'lizard' but still scored four points in
the "Animals" category for Team Plan B. Chad made his team proud with
eight points in "Animals", including J.D.'s clue of "simba with water"
for 'sealion'. Uncle Giant thought maybe "Animals" would help them out
and started out strong with his team making animal noises, but sort of
petered out near the end, finishing with an impressive eight
points. The Captain thought that "Animals" was a good theme and stuck
with it gaining five more points for Team Awesome. Grammy rounded up
Team B's proformance with "Animals" again, scoring an additional
five. J.D only had to score three for the win in his own game, and the
sweep in the DFC. Unfortunately, he failed miserably with just one
right. Team Plan B begins their comeback winning 19-17</p>
  <h2>Christmas Plate Drawing</h2>
  <p>This was the game Cat brought. Everyone put a paper plate on top of
their heads, and then Cat read out directions like "draw a floor", and
everyone draw it without looking. After she read all the direction,
there was a list of things that you could get points added or removed
for having drawn. In the end, everyone should've had a Christmas tree
decorated with a present under it, next to a fireplace and hearth with
a stocking hanging from it. Chad was robbed by having his tree decorations not
counted, giving Team Plan B the win, 28-24</p>
  <h2>Makin' Bacon Dice</h2>
  <p>This was the game Chad brought. It is similar to 10,000 or Farkle,
only the dice have "Makin'", "B", "a", "c", "o" and "n" on them. There
are points for various combination and is played until someone gets
6,000 points. If someone rolls "Makin' Bacon" in one roll, they score
6,000 thus ending the game. The Captain started the game off with a
score of 700, J.D. busted, Cat matched the Captain with 700, then
Lorelei, Uncle Giant and Eddie all busted. Grammy, upped the ante
taking Team Plan B ahead with an additional 400. Chad saw it, and
countered with 800. The Captain must've been tired of the game
and scored 6,000 with "Makin' Bacon" and ended the game. Team Awesome
had 7,500 points, Team Plan B with 1,200.</p>
