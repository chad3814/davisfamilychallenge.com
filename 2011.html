  <h1>Sixth Annual Davis Family Challenge</h1>
  <h2>Candy Cane Ruldolphs</h2>
  <p>The Tails' teamwork narrowly defeated the Heads. They completed
their 12 Rudulphs first.</p>
  <h2>Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader</h2>
  <p>After three rounds of five questions each, both teams were tied
at 14. We did a shoot-out and the Tails got their question and the
Heads failed.</p>
  <h2>Magnetic Rocket Toss</h2>
  <p>The Heads thoroughly destroyed the Tails 13-9.</p>
  <h2>House of Cards</h2>
  <p>High on their Magnetic Rocket Toss victory, the Heads were the
first team to think of bending the cards in half to make them
stand. They got their cards into a single structure first.</p>
  <h2>Hong Kong</h2>
  <p>The Tails took a commanding lead winning the first two games in a
best of five match. The Heads tried to get something started with a W
in the third game, but the Tails rallied for the win in the fourth game.</p>
